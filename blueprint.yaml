  The Hello World blueprint for Particle is a beginner-friendly IoT solution designed for new users to explore the Particle platform and development tools.

  This app connects your Particle device to the cloud and enables simple, periodic interactions. With this setup, the device sends a “Hello, World!” message to the Particle cloud every 10 seconds. You’ll be able to view these messages in real-time on the Particle dashboard.

  Using this app, you can quickly experience the basics of IoT: connecting a device, setting up event publishing, and visualizing data in the cloud. The template makes it easy to dive into firmware development, test the core features of the Particle ecosystem, and start working with cloud-based services, including Integrations, Logic, Ledger.
